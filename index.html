    </header>

    <div>
        <p align="center"><strong>Machine learning is an exciting branch of Artificial Intelligence, and it's all around
                us. Machine learning brings out the power of data in new ways, such as Facebook suggesting articles in
                your feed. This amazing technology helps computer systems learn and improve from experience by
                developing computer programs that can automatically access data and perform tasks via predictions and
                detections.</strong>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p align="center">
            <strong>As you input more data into a machine, this helps the algorithms teach the computer, thus improving
                the delivered results. When you ask Alexa to play your favorite music station on Amazon Echo, she will
                go to the station you played most often. You can further improve and refine your listening experience by
                telling Alexa to skip songs, adjust the volume, and many more possible commands. Machine Learning and
                the rapid advance of Artificial Intelligence makes this all possible.</strong>

        <h2 align="center">How Does Machine Learning Work?</h2>
    <div>
        <strong>
        <p align="center">Machine Learning is, undoubtedly, one of the most exciting subsets of Artificial Intelligence. It completes the task of learning from data with specific inputs to the machine. It's important to understand what makes Machine Learning work and, thus, how it can be used in the future.</p>

        <p align="center">The Machine Learning process starts with inputting training data into the selected algorithm. Training data being known or unknown data to develop the final Machine Learning algorithm. The type of training data input does impact the algorithm, and that concept will be covered further momentarily.</p> 
            
        <p align="center">New input data is fed into the machine learning algorithm to test whether the algorithm works correctly. The prediction and results are then checked against each other.</p>
            
        <p align="center">If the prediction and results don't match, the algorithm is re-trained multiple times until the data scientist gets the desired outcome. This enables the machine learning algorithm to continually learn on its own and produce the optimal answer, gradually increasing in accuracy over time.</p>

            <strong>  Applications of Machine Learning are: </strong>
        </h2>

        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> ML can be applied to predict and forecast various aspects including stock prediction using ML, travel duration, weather, sales of a store, eligibility of loan.
            </li>
            <br>    

            <li><strong>Medical diagnoses:</strong> Machine Learning can be implemented to detect terminal and non-terminal diseases.
            </li>
            <br>


            <li><strong>Financial industry and trading:</strong> companiesuse to detect fraudulent transactions, customers, make credit checks, credit defaults, optimize trading strategies using algorithms.</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>Image recognition:</strong> Using image segmentation techniques, machines can identify objects, persons, places, digital images.</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong> It is a process to convert the voice instructions and searches to text. It is the translation of spoken words into the text. Various virtual assistants such as Google Home Speakers, Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana use this technique.</li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>Automatic Language Translation, Auto-corrections:</strong> Machines can translate text from one language to another, auto-correct the spelling errors.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>Recommendation Engines:</strong> These are used by all the e-commerce retailers, movie web applications to recommend the next product or movie or web series to watch depending on the purchase or view history of the person and also based on what others have bought or seen based on your choice.</li>

    <h2 align="center">What is Deep Learning</h2>

    <div>
        <p class="deeplearning" align="center">Deep learning is a type of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) that imitates the way humans gain certain types of knowledge. Deep learning is an important element of data science, which includes statistics and predictive modeling. It is extremely beneficial to data scientists who are tasked with collecting, analyzing and interpreting large amounts of data; deep learning makes this process faster and easier.<br> <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/deep-learning-deep-neural-network#:~:text=Deep%20learning%20is%20a%20type,includes%20statistics%20and%20predictive%20modeling." target="_blank">Visit Tech Target </a> to know about deep learning in detail</p>
